# Restaurant-Management-System
A GUI where the user will be calculating the bill for the food items he/she orders.
                      Nowadays, the billing management is hard enough to 
maintain and not much easier to calculate the bills. On average, a 
man can take few mins to calculate the data. In that case, a software 
created using a computer machine coded using some programming 
language would rather take fractions of second to manipulate the data
and process the output.
                      The main advantage of the project is to reduce 
the efforts of the user to manipulate the bills at the restaurant. The 
solution to this problem is to create a GUI which has the user’s 
interaction with the software.
                       The GUI is created using modules, packages and 
libraries. Concepts of functions, root, sets and padding have been also 
implemented. Thus a simple restaurant management system for billing 
manipulation is created using Python GUI. In this way the restaurant’s  
billing management is simplified and accurate results are obtained using 
the application developed using Python GUI.
